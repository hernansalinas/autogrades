    "When a new planet is discovered, there are different methods to estimate its physical properties. Many times is only possible to estimate either the planet mass or the planet radius and the other property has to be predicted through computer modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one has the planet mass, a very rough way to estimate its radius is to assume certain composition (mean density) and a homogeneous distribution (a very bad assumption!). For example, for the planet [Gliese 832c](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_832_c) with a mass $M= 5.40 M_{\\oplus}$, if we assume an earth-like composition, i.e. $\\bar \\rho_{\\oplus} = 5520\\ kg/m^3$, we obtain:\n",
